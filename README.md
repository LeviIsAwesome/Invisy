Making people disappear since 2018.

## Demo
This demo was filmed at **The 2018 Local Hack Day** at University of Manitoba, and this project helped us awarded an **Honorable Mention** at the event üéä‚úåÔ∏èüéâ.

## Credit
This [Person-Blocker Repo](https://github.com/minimaxir/person-blocker) classifies the object in the still image, our implementations were based on this repo and turned its feature into real-time object detection.

## Idea and Techniques
Inspiration was from [Black Mirror White Christmas Episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dXqugxU1sk&t=44s) (Youtube Video) and the technique we used is called [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) which predicts an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition.

## Current Implementation: 
- phone uses ip webcam to set up web service with live video feed.
  - can replace with other video sources
- invisy grabs screenshots and sends them to the model for classification
- display the model output to the screen after processing
